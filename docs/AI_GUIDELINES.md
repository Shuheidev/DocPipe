# AI Contribution Guidelines

This project welcomes code generated by Codex or other AI tools. To keep the repository healthy and understandable, please follow these rules when submitting automated changes:

1. **Update Documentation** – Every feature or modification must be fully documented. Add or update pages in the `docs/` directory so that the current behaviour of the system is clearly described.
2. **Explain New Modules** – Describe the purpose of any new module, endpoint or configuration option you introduce. Include usage examples when appropriate.
3. **Keep the README Accurate** – If your changes affect the setup or usage instructions, modify `README.md` accordingly and reference any detailed notes in `docs/`.
4. **Run Tests** – Execute `pytest` and fix any failing tests before committing. If you add functionality, create corresponding tests.
5. **Maintain Clarity** – Write commit messages and documentation in a clear, human‑readable style.

Following these guidelines ensures that future agents or human developers can build on top of your work with minimal friction.
